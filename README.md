**MF821**  
Spring 2023, Math Finance, Boston University.  
This is not C++-Based but Python-Based course.  
Will get a paper account by an invitaion emails assuming being enrolled.

## My Goals for creating this respository
1. Make common sense in Math Finance/Financial Engineering which means I wanna try focusing on finance intuition more than coding things.  
2. Coding relative clear and simple codes at the limited time. If over the limited time I set, I would not explore better way for coding.  
3. Learn Github Basic Commands.



## Completed
HW1:  
1. Most of questions.  

HW2:  
1. All questions.  

## Incompleted
HW1:  
1. Cannot find Bid/Ask Volumes in self.reqHistoricalData Method.  
2. Cannot find the way to let app.run() stop without closing the App.  
3. I actually don't wanna create so many dataframes and symbols in the class.
  
HW2:  
1. I actually wanna create a class to solve all questions cuz it seems more clear and less codes by applying class.

## FYI
### Installations
1. Use package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install package in your Mac Terminal. i.e.  
```bash
pip install zipfile
```  
2. Install TWS Station and TWS Station API on the website.  
Although after logging in, there are things u still need to figure out.

### Useful Commands in Terminal (Mac Version)
Already known usage of `pip`  
Check the all file names in current directory: `ls`.  
Move to specific directory. i.e. Move from default to Desktop: `cd Desktop`.  
Print the path of the current: `pwd`
