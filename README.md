# MF821
Spring 2023, Math Finance, Boston University.  
This is not C++-Based but Python-Based course.

## My Goals for creating this respository
1. Make common sense in Math Finance/Finance Engineering which means I wanna try focusing on finance intuition more than coding things.  
2. Coding relative clear and simple codes at the limited time. If over the limited time I set, I would not explore better way for coding.  
3. Learn Github Basic Commands.

## Completed
HW1:  
1. Most of questions.  

HW2:  
1. All questions.  

## Incompleted
HW1:  
1. Cannot find Bid/Ask Volumes in self.reqHistoricalData Method.  
2. Cannot find the way to let app.run() stop without closing the App.  
3. I actually don't wanna create so many dataframes and symbols in the class.
  
HW2:  
1. I actually wanna create a class to solve all questions cuz it seems more clear and less codes by applying class.
